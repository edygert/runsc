# runsc

This code is based on the code from
https://github.com/Kdr0x/Kd_Shellcode_Loader by Gary "kd" Contreras. This
version has been generally cleaned up and uses a single source file that can
be compiled for either 32 or 64-bit. The ability to specify a file to open
and additional error checks were added too.
